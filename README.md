GitHub Api client 
===========================

# Consists of 

* Single Akka Actor 
* GithubApi client that uses Spray-can for requests
* Play-json for parsing github json responses

Should be able to connect to gitHubApi and fetch repositories with contributors, evaluate influence based on given formula. 

An example: 
`c.github.api.actor.GitHubClientActor - Repo name: sbt-republish and it's contributors: [ ]
 c.github.api.actor.GitHubClientActor - Repo name: sbt-multi-jvm and it's contributors: [ {
   "fullName" : "Jonas Bon√©r",
   "created" : "2008-05-18T23:22:48",
   "contributions" : 1,
   "followers" : 668,
   "influence" : 341.1
 }, {
   "fullName" : "Josh Suereth",
   "created" : "2008-10-15T06:44:44",
   "contributions" : 1,
   "followers" : 437,
   "influence" : 225.6
 }}]
`

Has some simple specs for actor behaviour and evaluation util.

Lacks a test for github communication.

Also due to amount of requests public github api will sometimes return 

    `{
       "message": "API rate limit exceeded for xyz (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)",
       "documentation_url": "https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting"
     }`
                                                                                 
# TODO: 
* Implement some sort of delay's between requests or worker actors, that could handle inner requests
